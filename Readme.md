## Execute the Application Example (AX Code local)

1. Open a command line interface (CLI) and switch to the target folder. Example, if the traget folder is D:\temp

      ```sh
      D:
      cd \temp
      ```

1. Install the application example on your local PC

      Run the following commands in a CLI

      ```sh
      apax create @simatic-ax/ae-trafficlight --registry https://npm.pkg.github.com ae-trafficlight
      ```

      Open `AxCode` with

      ```sh
      cd ae-trafficlight 
      ```

      install the dependencies with:

      ```sh
      apax install
      ```

      and open AxCode

      ```sh
      axcode . 
      ```

1. If not open, open a terminal (`CTRL+SHIFT+รถ`)

1. Start a PLCSIM Advanced Instance (IP: Address 192.168.0.1). To change the IP you'll find information [here](#tips-and-tricks)

1. If not done, download a valid hardware configuration (FW >= 2.9 and IP address 192.168.0.1) to the PLCSIM Advanced Instance. The recommend way is using TIA Portal.

1. Build in download the project to the PLC

   ```cli
   apax dlplc
   ```

   The project will be compiled and downloaded to the PLCSIM Advanced instance

1. Open the monitoring file mon.mon

1. Go online
